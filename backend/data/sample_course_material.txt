# General Math and Basic Facts
1+1=2
2+2=4
Multiplication: 3*3=9, 4*5=20, etc.
Basic arithmetic is foundational to many computer science operations.

# Sorting Algorithms
Bubble sort: Repeatedly compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
Selection sort: Finds the minimum element and puts it at the beginning.
Insertion sort: Builds the sorted array one item at a time.
Merge sort: Divides the list into halves, sorts them and merges them.
Quick sort: Selects a pivot and partitions the array around it.

# Recursion Basics
Recursion is a technique where a function calls itself.
A base case stops the recursion.
For example, factorial(n) = n * factorial(n-1) with factorial(1)=1 as base case.

# Python Programming Basics
Variables: Used to store values, e.g., x=10.
Data types: int, float, str, list, dict, tuple, etc.
Control structures: if/else, for loops, while loops.
Functions: Defined using 'def' keyword.
Example: 
def add(a, b): return a+b

# Data Science Concepts
Data cleaning: Removing or fixing malformed data.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Using statistics and visualization to understand data.
Machine Learning: Training models to make predictions or find patterns.

# AI and LLM Agents
Large Language Models (LLMs) can understand and generate text.
They can be used as agents to interact with tools, generate code, or answer questions.
Retrieval-augmented generation: Combines LLMs with document retrieval for context.
LLM agents can plan, reason, and execute actions (e.g., making an API call) to solve complex tasks.

# Additional General Knowledge
The capital of France is Paris.
The speed of light is approximately 299,792,458 m/s.
Basic unit of life is the cell.
1+1=2 is a fundamental arithmetic fact known universally.

# More on Complexity
Time complexity of bubble sort: O(n^2).
Time complexity of merge sort: O(n log n).

# Example of Code in Python for Sorting
def bubble_sort(arr): n = len(arr) for i in range(n): for j in range(0, n - i - 1): if arr[j] > arr[j + 1]: arr[j], arr[j + 1] = arr[j + 1], arr[j] return arr


# Mentoring and Education Context
An AI study companion can guide students by explaining concepts, answering questions, and providing examples.
If a question is not in the documents, a good AI assistant might use general reasoning to answer.

# Tool Use Case
The LLM can run Python code snippets and show the output.
For instance, if the user provides a code snippet:
print("Hello World")

The tool can run it and return "Hello World".
